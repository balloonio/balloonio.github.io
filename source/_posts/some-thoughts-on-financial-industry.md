Given the chance of writing a personal statement for my graduate school application, I had the time to collect my thoughts and views on financial industry. Here I would like to share some part of it.

{% blockquote First paragraph from my personal statement for MathFin application %}
Forty years ago, if anyone walked into NYSE trading floor, he/she would see crowds of traders staring at big screens, shouting and making hand signals. Nowadays however, even on the exchange’s busiest days, there are way less people but, instead, more computers. Whenever I think about finance, these images pop into my mind, not only because NYSE is the most symbolic landmark among all US exchanges, but more so that its trading floor is always a reflection of what finance is. Forty years ago, finance is all about information. Internet didn’t exist; nor were cell phones widely used. Information was hardly available in a timely fasion – policies, news, or even bid/ask prices. That’s exactly why traders flooded on the trading floor back then. The big screens give the latest bid/ask spread, while the floor traders themselves chitchat about the latest news. You get the latest information, you make a phone call, you seal the deal and win the game. Yet forty years later, the game has changed. The rise of computational power brought revolution to financial industry. As the frontline of this revolution, the trading floor reflects every change. Machines and electronic trading platforms eliminate the need for floor trading and open outcry by quite a lot. Moreover, next door to its trading floor, the exchange is making “new” money by selling colocation services to HFTs. Financial industry has been reshaped in every way. In fact, computers and internet are so prevailing that information is no longer scarcity. Instead, data and algorithm are today’s theme of finance. Today’s computational resources are so powerful that they can perfectly execute even the most complicated algorithms or analyze even the biggest data size. As a result, what used to be 1ms or 1% return difference between a good algorithm and a bad one, now could be 5ms or 1% difference. Whoever gets the most data and trains the best algorithm wins the game. Even though finance is not only about algotrading, it is fair to say that algorithmic trading and quantitative strategies are taking over more and more places in today’s financial world. And those are exactly what I’m interested in.
