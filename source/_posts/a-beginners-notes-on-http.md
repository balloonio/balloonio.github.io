Coming from a non-CS background, HTTP always seems to be a mystery to me. As I learned more about front-end technologies, I started to realize that understanding HTTP protocal is really important. Working on a Django project without understanding how HTTP works is like writing an assembly program without understanding CPU architecture - it is very easy to get lost. Fortunately, I came across some very helpful materials. Here I want to share my study notes on those materials.

# What is HTTP?

{% blockquote Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Technical_overview Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) %}
HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server computing model. A web browser, for example, may be the client and an application running on a computer hosting a website may be the server. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.
